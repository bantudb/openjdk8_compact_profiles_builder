# openjdk8_compact_profiles_builder
OpenJDK 8 compact profiles build too

## TODO LIST ##
* Change all scripts to take profile number to be created as a parameter
* Add more error checks to both scripts
* Change build script to determine PLATFORM_NAME from spec.gmk (CONF_NAME value or simply location of generated spec.gmk under work folder)
* Add ability to generate profile 3 with java beans
* Investigate what it would take to add ability to generate custom compact profiles
